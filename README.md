Redesign for Reddit Home page

We all love **reddit** so I redesigned reddit's home page,
to allow better user experience.

This is only the home page, meaning the links to other pages would redirect you
to reddit pages.

The idea was to provide the users with a more organized and clear layout,
so they will enjoy reddit even more :wink:

Here are a few screen shots of the **reddit redesigned page**:
